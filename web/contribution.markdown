* a README file describing:
  * the contributing author and their affiliation (as well as any other relevant contributor),
  * the IDs of the JWST/HST programmes,
  * and all the references that need to be cited for the catalogue.

* an ECSV file listing the:
  * RA and DEC (J200),
  * pixel coordinates within the original images,
  * a probability of detection,
  * and then all the magnitudes and their error in the filters available
