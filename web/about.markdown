This is the main repository of the photometric catalogues of bright star clusters in galaxy clusters obtained from JWST/NIRCam imaging. These catalogues are being derived from a variety of programmes (CANUCS, PEARLS, GLIMPSE), as listed in the Zenodo repository of each galaxy cluster. 

The catalogues are available upon reasonable request, please see our [Collaboration page]({{ site.baseurl }}/collaboration/) for contact information.
