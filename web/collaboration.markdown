The photometric catalogues of GCs listed in this website have been obtained by (in alphabetical order):
* Jessica Berkheimer (Arizona State University)
* Bill Harris (McMaster University)
* Tyler Hinrichs (Arizona State University)
* Kaitlyn Keatley (McMaster University)

using NIRCam imaging from a variety of JWST programmes. More details on the particular observational data used and the references to be cited are listed on the README files of each galaxy cluster.

If you are interested in using either of these catalogues, please send an email to Bill Harris and Marta Reina-Campos -- [Contact us](mailto:harrisw@mcmaster.ca,reinacampos@cita.utoronto.ca?subject=Interest%20on%20the%20JWST%20catalogues) -- or contact us via the Zenodo repositories.
